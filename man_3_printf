.SH NAME
_printf

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"
int _printf(const char *format, ...)


.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions in the _printf produce output accourding to a format. The function _printf will write output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.

.SH FORMAT
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier. 

.SH FLAG CHARACTERS

d, i

The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

s

If no l modifier is present the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to a terminating null byte ('\0');

c

the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

%

the % argument will be printed when the character % is not followed by any other option than another % character
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.SH EXAMPLE
print the string "hello, world!" followed by a new line.

#include "holberton.h"


int main()


{


	_printf("%d\n", hello, world!);


		return 0;


}
.SH BUGS
The i and d flags are not working properly to take into account the INT_MIN.
